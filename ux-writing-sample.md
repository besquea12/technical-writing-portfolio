# UX Writing Improvement: Login Error States
*Goal: Reduce user frustration and support tickets by clarifying error messages.*

## The Problem
The current app displays a generic "Error 401" when a login fails. This leaves users confused about whether they got their password wrong or if the server is down.

### Before (System-Centric)
> **Headline:** Error 401
> **Body:** Unauthorized access. Please check credentials or contact sys-admin.
> **Button:** OK

---

## The Solution (User-Centric)
I redesigned the copy to be helpful, conversational, and actionable.

### After (My Redesign)
> **Headline:** We couldn't sign you in
> **Body:** That password doesn't match our records. You can try again or reset it if you've forgotten it.
> **Primary Button:** Try Again
> **Secondary Link:** Reset Password

## Why This Works
1. **Empathy:** Replaced "Unauthorized" (which sounds like an accusation) with "We couldn't sign you in."
2. **Clarity:** Specifically identifies that the *password* is the likely issue.
3. **Next Steps:** Provides a direct link to "Reset Password" so the user isn't stuck.
